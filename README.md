## Run the project

- The project has been deployed to GitHub Pages.
- "Country List" allows you to view all countries' flags and search for countries.
- "Manage Flags" allows you to mark which flags you have memorized. Click on a flag in "Unmemorized" to add it to "Memorized" and vice-versa.
- "Flash Cards" allows you to casually test your flag knowlege. Memorized flags will not be shown.
- "Flag Quiz" automatically creates a multiple-choice quiz of the desired length. At the end, you are given the opportunity to mark the flags from the quiz as "memorize" or "unmemorized".
